### Hi there 👋

 - 🔭 I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich. I specialize in the macroecology of marine zooplankton. 
 - 🔭 I’m currently working on: modelling the patterns and drivers in global marine plankton species diversity and composition, and investigating how the latter relate to ecosystem functioning, based on field observations and statistical empirical modelling.
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning German. It's not easy.
 - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects aiming to achieve better biodiversity conservation, on land or in the oceans.
 - 🤔 I’m looking for help with building and analyzing co-occurrence networks with R based on community tables.
 - 💬 Ask me about copepods. Trust me they are amazing. You could also ask me about: species distribution modelling (SDM), multivariate data analysis (PCA, MCA, CA, clustering, etc.), data/time series analysis, functional diversity indices, zooplankton imaging data, mapping, data vizualisation with the ggplot2 R package.
 - 📫 How to reach me: fabio.benedetti@usys.ethz.ch 
 - 😄 Pronouns: he/him but some friends also call me the piglet.
 - ⚡ Fun fact: I can model climate change impacts on global marine diversity but I still can't use a bicycle.
