### Hi there 👋

<!--
**benfabio/benfabio** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

### - 🔭 I’m currently working on: modelling the patterns and drivers in global marine plankton species diversity and composition, and investigating how the latter relate to ecosystem functioning, based on field observations and statistical empirical modelling.
### - 🌱 I’m currently learning German. It's not easy.
### - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects aiming to achieve better biodiversity conservation, on land or in the oceans.
### - 🤔 I’m looking for help with building and analyzing co-occurrence networks with R based on community tables.
### - 💬 Ask me about copepods. Trust me they are amazing. You could also ask me about: species distribution modelling (SDM), multivariate data analysis (PCA, MCA, CA, clustering, etc.), data/time series analysis, functional diversity indices, zooplankton imaging data, mapping, data vizualisation with the ggplot2 R package.
### - 📫 How to reach me: fabio.benedetti@usys.ethz.ch 
### - 😄 Pronouns: he/him but some friends also call me the piglet.
### - ⚡ Fun fact: I can model climate change impacts on global marine diversity but I still can't use a bicycle.
