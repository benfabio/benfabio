### Hi there 👋

 - 🔭 I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich. I am a macroecologist specialized in marine plankton. 
 - 🔭 I’m currently working on modelling the patterns and drivers of global marine plankton diversity and composition and investigating how the latter relate to ecosystem functioning, based on field observations and empirical modelling.
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning German. It's not easy.
 - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects promoting/achieving biodiversity conservation, on land or in the oceans.
 - 🤔 I’m looking for help with building and analyzing co-occurrence networks with R based on community tables.
 - 💬 Ask me about copepods. Trust me they are amazing. You could also ask me about: species distribution modelling (SDM), multivariate data analysis (PCA, MCA, CA, clustering, etc.), data/time series analysis, functional diversity indices, zooplankton imaging data, mapping, data vizualisation with the ggplot2 R package.
 - 📫 How to reach me: fabio.benedetti@usys.ethz.ch 
 - ⚡ Fun fact: I can model climate change impacts on global marine diversity but I still can't use a bicycle (actually more of a sad fact than a fun fact).
