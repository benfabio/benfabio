### Hi there 👋

 - 🔭 I'm currently a data analyst/postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich & Uni. Bern in Switzerland. I am a numerical ecologist (community ecologist, macroecologist, you name it!) specialized in marine plankton ecology and trait-based approaches. 
 - 🔭 I study how Biodiversity changes on Earth, across different systems and at different scales. I want to help better understand the role of Biodiversity in delivering ecosystem functions and services.
 - 🌱 I’m also currently learning German. It's not easy.
 - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects promoting/achieving Biodiversity conservation on land or in the oceans.
 - 💬 Ask me about planktonic copepods. Trust me they are amazing. You could also ask me about species distribution modelling (SDM), multivariate data analysis (PCA, MCA, CA, clustering, etc.), empirical models (supervised & unsupervised ML), data/time series analysis, functional diversity indices, mapping or data visualisation with the ggplot2 R package.
 - 📫 How to reach me: fabio.benedetti@usys.ethz.ch or fabio.benedetti@unibe.ch
