### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**benfabio/benfabio** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modelling the global patterns in marine plankton species diversity and composition and investigating how the latter relate to ecosystem functioning.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning German. It's not easy.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects aiming to achieve better biodiversity conservation, on land or in the oceans.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building and analyzing co-occurrence networks with R based on community tables.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about copepods. Trust me, they are amazing.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: fabio.benedetti@usys.ethz.ch 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him but some friends also call me the piglet.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can model climate change impacts on global marine diversity but I still can't use a bicycle.
