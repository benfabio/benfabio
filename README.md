### Hi there 👋

 - 🔭 I'm currently a data analyst/postdoctoral researcher at Uni. Bern in Switzerland. I am a numerical ecologist (or a community ecologist, or a macroecologist, you name it!) specialized in the functional ecology of marine plankton and trait-based approaches. 
 - 🔭 I study how Biodiversity changes on Earth across different systems and scales. I want to help better understand the role of Biodiversity in delivering ecosystem functions and services.
 - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects promoting/achieving Biodiversity conservation on land or in the oceans.
 - 💬 Ask me about planktonic copepods. Trust me they are amazing. You could also ask me about species distribution modelling (SDM), multivariate data analysis (PCA, MCA, CA, clustering, etc.), empirical models (supervised & unsupervised ML), data/time series analysis, functional diversity indices, mapping or data visualisation with the ggplot2 R package.
 - 📫 How to reach me: fabio.benedetti@unibe.ch
